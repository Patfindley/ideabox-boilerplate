# Ideabox Group Project

Every developer has more ideas than time. As David Allen likes to say "the human brain is for creating ideas, not remembering them." In this project, we'll be building an application that records and archives our ideas (good and bad alike).

Throughout the project, one of our focuses will be on providing a fluid and responsive client-side interface. To this end, we'll rely on JavaScript to implement snappy filtering in the browser, and `localStorage` to persist our wonderful ideas between sessions.

## Learning Goals

* Gain an understanding of how to write clean HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
* Understand how to implement client-side data persistence using `localStorage`
* Understand what it looks like to have a separate data model (using a class) and DOM model
* Incorporate & iterate over arrays in order to filter what is being displayed
* Craft code with clean style, using small functions that show trends toward DRYness and SRP

## Functionality
*Ideabox: a web app to store, organize, and display user-submitted "idea cards"*

#### Create & Remove Ideas Cards
- In this application, a user is able to create an idea card using the title and body inputs. Once they choose a title and body, they can save their card using the "save" button and it will populate in the space below the form. There is a "remove" (X) button in the top right corner of each card that will delete the entire content from both the page and from storage.

#### Add Cards to "Favorites"
- Each idea card has "favorite" (star) button in the top left corner that will change from white to red when clicked by the user. The user may also click the "Show Starred" button to filter the cards so that they only see their favorited idea cards.

#### Use "Instant Search" to Filter Cards
- A user can search through all of their saved cards using the search bar. Their idea cards will filter as the user types their query, showing only the cards that include their search characters.

#### Web Accessibility
- Our application has fully implemented HTML that is accessible for individuals with visual disabilities. Our application passes the WAVE audit tool.
